# Numerical-Linear-Algebra-in-Python

This repository conatains codes written in conjunction with the Utah State Univeristy Math 6610: "Advanced Computational Linear Algebra and Solutions of Nonlinear Systems of Equations" course taught by Dr. Jia Zhao in the Spring 2019 semester. 

There are three main questions we wish to address in this class:

1. Given a matrix A and a vector b, find the solution x to the equation Ax = b. Here we assume that a unique solution exists (i.e. A is intervtible). We aim to write accurate and effecient algorithms to solve this problem for large matricies computationally.

2. If no soluiton exists find a good approximation for x to mimmize Ax-b.

3. The eigen value problem Ax = &#955; x
